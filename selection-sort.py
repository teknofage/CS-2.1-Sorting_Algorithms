"""Implementation
The trick to implementing this algorithm is keeping track of the minimum value and swapping two elements of the list. Open a file named sort.py in your favorite editor and enter the following code in it:
"""

def selection_sort(L):
    # i indicates how many items were sorted
    for i in range(len(L)-1):
        # To find the minimum value of the unsorted segment
        # We first assume that the first element is the lowest
        min_index = i
        # We then use j to loop through the remaining elements
        for j in range(i+1, len(L)-1):
            # Update the min_index if the element at j is lower than it
            if L[j] < L[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        # After finding the lowest item of the unsorted regions, swap with the first unsorted item
        L[i], L[min_index] = L[min_index], L[i]
"""Now let's add some code to the file to test the algorithm:"""

L = [3, 1, 41, 59, 26, 53, 59]
print(L)
selection_sort(L)

# Let's see the list after we run the Selection Sort
print(L)
